### Can I use this on a commercial Joomla site?

**Yes**, absolutely. GPL allows commercial use without restrictions.

### Can I remove the "mySites.guru" branding?

**Technically yes**, but we request you keep attribution to respect our work. Removing copyright notices violates GPL terms.

### Can I sell Health Checker?

**Yes**, but you must provide source code and maintain GPL v2+ license. Anyone you sell to can redistribute it for free.

### Can I create a proprietary fork?

**No**, derivative works must remain GPL v2+. You can create private modifications but if distributed, they must be GPL.

### Can I integrate with proprietary extensions?

**Yes**, as long as Health Checker itself remains GPL v2+. Your proprietary code can interact with it.

### Do I need to contribute my modifications back?

**No**, but we encourage it! You only need to provide source code to those you distribute to.
